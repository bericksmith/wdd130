    <h2>Berick (Bear) Smith</h2>
    <p>I recently completed a PathwayConnect certificate and I am currently working on a BS in Applied Technology. 
        The first step for me in that process is to complete the Web and Computer Programming certificate.</p> 
    <p>I have worked in the hi-tech industry close to 30 years for a company called Wacom Technology</p>
    <p>My wife and I have five children (29, 27, 24, 21 and 17), three girls and two boys. My two boys are currently attending BYU-I also, so that is pretty cool. We have 5 grandchildren and want a million more!</p>
    <p>Here is a recent photo of us all:</p>

    <p>I have been a member of the church all my life.  I served a spanish speaking full-time mission in Bogota, Columbia and Quito, Ecuador.</p>
    <p>We were married in the Portland, Oregon temple and my three married children have also been sealed in that temple. I currently work as an ordinance worker in that temple.</p>

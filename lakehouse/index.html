            <button class="accordion">Do you allow early check-ins and late check-outs?</button>
            <div class="panel">
              <p>Early check-in and out is handled on a case-by-case basis depending on the availability of the property.  It is important that we have ample time to clean and prepare each rental in between visits by renters.  Because if this we may not be able to accommodate all these types of requests.  Please call us at 888-867-5309 and we can see it those options are available for your dates.</p>
